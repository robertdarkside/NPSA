  about:
    "The people of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service take pride in serving those who defend America. We take our contribution to national defense seriously. We work hard to fulfill the important fiscal responsibilities entrusted to us by the American taxpayers. We ensure the resources they provide are accounted for properly. In fiscal year 2023, DFAS: Processed 135.4 Million Pay Transactions (6.6 million people/accounts) Paid 11.7 Million Commercial Invoices Made 4.8 Million Travel Payments Made $598.2  Billion in Disbursements Made $171.9 Billion in Intragovernmental Payments (IPAC) Maintained 50.7 Million General Ledger Accounts  Accounted for 1,601 Active DoD Appropriations Managed $25.3 Billion in Accounts Receivables Managed $1.8 Trillion in Military Retirement and Health Benefits Funds Managed Foreign Military Sales Cases reimbursed by foreign governments valued at $755 Billion A brief look at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service In 1991, the Secretary of Defense created the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to standardize, consolidate, and improve accounting and financial functions throughout the DoD. The intent was to reduce the cost of the Department's finance and accounting operations while strengthening its financial management.  DFAS pays all DoD military and civilian personnel, retirees and annuitants, as well as major DoD contractors and vendors. DFAS also supports customers outside the DoD in support of electronic government initiatives. Customers include the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Energy, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Agency for Global Media.  Since its inception, the agency has consolidated more than 300 installation-level offices into 10 DFAS sites and reduced the number of systems in use from 330 to 70. As a result of BRAC efforts begun in FY 2006, DFAS has closed 20 sites, realigned headquarters from Arlington to Indianapolis and established a liaison location in Alexandria, Virginia. DFAS is financed as a Working Capital Fund, obtaining revenue by charging its customers for the services it provides rather than being funded through direct appropriations. The agency sets annual rates two years in advance based on anticipated workload and estimated costs calculated to offset any prior year gains or losses. DFAS operations are subject to oversight by DoD as well as the executive and legislative branches of the federal government. DFAS has steadily reduced operating costs and has returned those savings to its customers in the form of decreased bills and improved service. These savings are a result of the agency's robust search for continuous innovation and enhanced business practices.",
